# Dual-sPLS: Full theory and reimplementation from R to Python

> A pedagogical deep dive into Partial Least Squares (PLS) and its sparse variants, leading to a Python implementation of the Dual-SPLS algorithm.

## Learning Path

To fully grasp the mechanics behind the algorithms, it is recommended to follow the notebooks in this specific order:

### 1. Fundamentals: `docs/PLS.ipynb`
### 2. Introducing Sparsity: `docs/sPLS.ipynb`
### 3. The Dual Approach: `docs/Dual_sPLS.ipynb`
### 4. First production Implementation: `src/dual_spls/lasso.py`

Then the other implementations correspond to the different norms presented in the paper.
